It folows the System V ABI.\r\nAll the system calls are exposed through int 0x80, although it will be changed to syscall over the time.\r\nSpartix's purpose is to be function-heavy, and light-weight when possible. Bloat is a *NOT* a necessary evil for functionality, as software can be very functional, while remaining light-weight. Spartix will never turn into a glibc or a systemd, as those pieces of software add unnecessary crap to its binary.\r\n## Development\r\nIf you want to help out in the development of Spartix, you can try joining #spartix on freenode, or fixing issues on GitHub's issue tracker.\r\n",
